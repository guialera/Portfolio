        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Full Stack Devloper (MERN) and a trained biochemist with over 10 years of research experience. I am
            fluent in JavaScript, React.js. Node.js, and Express.js with additional experience utilizing MongoDB.
            I am inately curious and enjoy learning new skills to continue growing as a software developer. In addition,
            I have the flexibility to work on a team as well as independently. I am motivated by solving complex
            problems and thrive in ambiguous settings where solutions to problems are not always evident. I love
            traveling and exploring the remote wilderness of Iceland and look forward to visiting new destinations in
            the near future!
